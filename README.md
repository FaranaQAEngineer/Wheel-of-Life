Moreover, this application is also helpful in emergencies. Disabled individuals can use the app  to locate nearby police stations and medical services.
The "Wheel of Life" app addresses a critical need for individuals requiring wheelchairs by 
providing essential accessibility information in an intuitive and user-friendly interface. With nearly 1% of the global population relying on wheelchairs for mobility, the app fills a
